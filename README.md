# cAI-tools
A collection of Claude Code plugins containing custom agents, skills, commands, and notification hooks.

Tested with **macOS** Claude Code v2.0.76+.

The plugin is made conservative in context usage by keeping concise and precise writing.

## Plugins

| Plugin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **awesome-agent** | Collection of useful prompted subagents for code review, API docs, QA, and more. Variant from: [awesome-claude-code-subagents](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents) |
| **AI-skill** | Skills for interacting with other AI tools - Codex, Gemini CLI, and collaboration fixes. Codex is a variant from [Skill Codex](https://github.com/skills-directory/skill-codex)|
| **pushover** | Pushover notification hooks - get notified when tasks complete or permissions are needed |
| **mac** | macOS integration - speak, send iMessages, emails, manage calendar, and display stickies |

## Example:
1. **AI-skill**: 
```bash
Use codex and gemini-cli to review uncommitted changes.
```
```bash
Check this with codex
```
```bash
AI-skill:collob-fix Fix the bug showing here as ### Bug 3
```

2. **mac**: 
```bash 
after you finish, use mac to say "All done" and a brief summary of what you did.
``` 
```bash 
Use imessage to send me (my email address/phone number) a message "Task complete" with the summary.
```
```bash
Can you add this to my stikies?
```

```bash
Use mac to generate today's calendar schedule with the information on my stikies.
```

## Known Issues:
1. Pushover: Claude Code does not have a hook that fires specifically when a user rejects a permission prompt. The system relies on subsequent activity (like `Stop` or `UserPromptSubmit`) to cancel escalations(a daemon that send notification by timing). I believe this is a limitation of Claude Code's current hook system, and should be addressed in future versions. We now use a simple session-level tracking to manage escalations. The Pushover is now very annoying because of the 60s, but it is a good push for me. You can change it here [escalation service](plugins/pushover/scripts/service/escalation_service.py)
2. mac: The `ical.sh` script reads all calendars but only writes to a calendar named "Agent". If your calendar contains sensitive information, be cautious when using this skill.
3. All email/message/calendar features depend on the respective macOS apps being properly configured with accounts. First run of osascript may prompt for permissions.
